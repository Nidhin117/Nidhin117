[Code Word Detection By Large Language Models](https://github.com/Nidhin117/Codeword-Detection-by-LLM)<br>
<b>Tech Stack: Python,Pandas, Hugging Face, OpenAI, VertexAI, FastText </b><br>
Abstract : Various machine learning and deep learning models have been developed over the years for code word detection, each with its own set of complexities such as the requirement for a large dataset for training, intricate preprocessing steps and substantial hardware resources. <br>
This paper explores the code word detection capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) such as GPT-3, and PaLM among several others. Through several experiments, I have proved that Large Language Models can achieve state-of-the-art results at code word detection tasks, without requiring extensive training or fine-tuning of these models. LLMs significantly outperform a baseline model which was trained on the same dataset that was used to test the LLMs.<br>
